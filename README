1. Overview
===========

This BSP layer is used to support Intel next generation of communication processors,
the Grand Ridge Base Transceiver Station (BTS) product family.

1.1 Dependencies
----------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River Linux, the
wrlinux layer and generic intel-x86 BSP layer.

1.2 Maintenance
---------------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.

1.3 Building the intel-grand-ridge layer
----------------------------------------
This layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This is done automatically
when using the Wind River setup.sh wrapper.

To the BSP, use "--machine=intel-grand-ridge".
